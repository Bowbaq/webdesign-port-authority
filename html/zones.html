				<h1>Zones</h1><br>
				<h4>Fare Zones Overview</h4><br>
				<p>Port Authority operates a zone-based fare structure. The amount of fare is based on trip length originating from Downtown Pittsburgh. Higher fares are paid for trips crossing more than one zone.<br><br>
				<img class="zones" src="img/zones2.png"/>
				<br><br>Port Authority‘s system consists of:<br><br><ul><li>A Free Fare Zone which includes Downtown Pittsburgh on the bus and Downtown/North Shore on the T light rail system</li><li>Two primary fare zones outside Downtown – Zone 1 and Zone 2 – and a small overlap zone, Zone 1A, in limited areas.</li><ul><br>Trips that begin and end within the same zone are charged a one-zone fare, with the exception of trips taken entirely within the Free Fare Zone.</p><br>
				<h4>Fare Free Zone</h4><br>
				<p>The Free Fare Zone was established to promote the use of transit within Downtown Pittsburgh, encourage intramodal transfer and reduce boarding delays.</p>
				<h3>T Free Fare Zone</h3><br>
				<p>Rides within the T‘s Free Fare Zone are free at all times. The zone includes the following stations: <br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Downtown Pittsburgh: First Avenue Station, Steel Plaza, Wood Street Station and Gateway</li>
						<li>North Shore: North Side Station and Allegheny Station</li>
					</ul><br>
					Free rides to North Shore stations are provided thanks to sponsorship agreements with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rivers Casino, ALCO Parking and the Stadium Authority of the City of Pittsburgh.</p><br>

					<h4>Bus Free Fare Zone</h4><br>
					<p>For the bus, the Free Fare Zone is defined by the following boundaries:<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>The Allegheny River</li>
						<li>The Monongahela River</li>
						<li>Ross Street, Penn Station and Liberty Avenue at the railroad overpass and 11th Street</li>
						</ul><br>
						For bus riders, fares are free within this zone from start of service until 7:00 p.m., seven days a week. </p><br>
					<h4>Zone 1</h4><br>
					<p>Zone 1 is the closest fare zone to Downtown Pittsburgh. Riders traveling within Zone 1 or between Zone 1 and Downtown Pittsburgh/Zone 1A pay a one-zone fare, $2.50 for adult full fare. Riders traveling from between Zone 1 and Zone 2 pay a two-fare fare, $3.75 for adult full fare.</p><br>

					<h4>Zone 1A</h4><br>
					<p>Zone 1A is an overlap zone between Zones 1 and 2. It is limited to certain areas in Wilkinsburg/the east suburbs, the Mon Valley, the Waterworks and the Kane Center in Scott Township (see map). Riders traveling between Zone 1A and any other zone pay a one-zone fare, $2.50 for adult full fare.</p><br>
